    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p><strong>Hexy</strong> is a six-legged robot that has been designed to confidently explore tricky terrain. While traditional wheeled robots may become stuck and bipedal ones may be unstable, Hexyâ€™s hexapod structure provides the balance and control needed to move smoothly across everything from rocky ground to city rubble and even potential use on other planets.</p>

    <p>Developed as part of a graduate research project at NYU, Hexy has been built for intelligent movement. <strong>Model Predictive Control (MPC)</strong> is used to plan steps in real time, while camera and IMU data are fused to estimate location and motion. With <strong>Visual SLAM</strong>, the surrounding environment is mapped during navigation, and <strong>autonomous obstacle avoidance</strong> enables the robot to adapt its path in response to unexpected barriers.</p>

    <p>Whether industrial sites are being inspected or distant terrains are being explored, Hexy has been designed to go where other robots cannot.</p>

    <p><em>Advantages of Hexapod over other designs are shown in the table below:</em></p>

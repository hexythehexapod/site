        <h3>Shantanu Ghodgaonkar</h3>
        <p>Roboticist passionate about exploring the fascinating intersection of optimal control, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and legged robots. As a Master’s student in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering at NYU, I love diving into complex challenges. Whether it’s designing algorithms for multi-DOF robots, developing vision-based model predictive control systems, or optimizing robot trajectories. With hands-on experience in tools like ROS, PyTorch, and OpenCV, I’m driven by the opportunity to bridge theory and real-world applications, pushing the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve.</p>
